# Private Grant Guard - Project Summary

## Project Overview

Private Grant Guard is a decentralized scholarship management platform built with FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) for privacy-preserving grant applications and disbursements. The platform ensures that sensitive academic and financial data remains encrypted while still allowing for transparent and verifiable scholarship processes.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture
- **FHE Integration**: All sensitive data (academic scores, financial need, amounts) is encrypted using Zama FHEVM
- **Encrypted Storage**: Student data, grant amounts, and academic records are stored as encrypted values on-chain
- **Privacy Preservation**: No sensitive information is exposed during contract interactions

### 💼 Wallet Integration
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Integrated RainbowKit for seamless wallet connections
- **Supported Wallets**: MetaMask, Rainbow, WalletConnect, and other popular wallets
- **Real-time Connection**: Live wallet status and address display
- **Secure Transactions**: All transactions are properly signed and verified

### 🎓 Smart Contract Features
- **Grant Applications**: Students can submit encrypted grant applications
- **Academic Verification**: Academic records are verified on-chain with FHE
- **Disbursement Management**: Automated and transparent grant disbursements
- **Reputation System**: Students and institutions build reputation through verified interactions
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate roles for students, verifiers, and treasury

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI components
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Professional and accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development
- **Custom Branding**: Unique favicon and branding elements

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with full IntelliSense support
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection UI components
- **Viem**: TypeScript interface for Ethereum

### Smart Contract Stack
