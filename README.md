## Architecture

### Smart Contract Features

- **Encrypted Data Storage**: All sensitive information is stored as encrypted values
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate roles for students, verifiers, and treasury
- **Automated Workflows**: Application submission, review, and disbursement processes
- **Reputation Tracking**: On-chain reputation for students and institutions

### Frontend Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with multiple wallet providers
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI components
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates for applications and disbursements
- **Privacy Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for encrypted data

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain
- Private keys are never exposed to the application
- Smart contracts include proper access controls and validation
- Regular security audits recommended for production deployment
